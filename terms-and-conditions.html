                            payable. Fees charged are nonrefundable. In the case of subscription products, the
                            subscription term shall be effective for the agreed upon period, after which the
                            subscription term shall automatically renew for the specified renewal period (if any) at the
                            then current subscription price.
                            (b) Recurring Billing: If applicable, your acceptance of these terms constitutes your
                            authorization to Cashyew Data to automatically charge the credit/debit card provided by you,
                            and in the case of subscription products, to continue charging the credit/debit card at the
                            agreed-upon intervals during the term of the subscription. You agree to provide Cashyew Data
                            with complete and accurate billing and contact information and to update that information
                            with thirty (30) days of any change to the billing information. Failure of the recurring
                            payment process does not absolve your payment obligations.
                            (c) Termination for Subscription: The initial term of this Agreement shall be (1) month from
                            the date on the order submission (“Initial Term”). Unless otherwise noted on an Order Form,
                            after the Initial Term, provided neither party has terminated, this Agreement shall
                            automatically renew for additional one (1) month terms (each an “Additional Term”). Either
                            party may terminate this Agreement during the Initial Term, or any Additional Term, by
                            providing 30 days written termination notice to the other Party. In the event of termination
                            by either party, Client will be responsible to pay for the fees due hereunder for the final
                            30 days of the Term. The Initial Term, together with the Additional Terms, shall be
                            considered the “Term.”
                            (d) Interest Charges: There will be interest charges on any amounts which you fail to pay
                            when due at the rate of 1.5% a month, or such lower rate as may be equal to the maximum rate
                            allowed by applicable law, on the unpaid amount.
                            (e) Credit Card Payment: By submitting this credit card authorization, you are authorizing
                            Cashyew to immediately charge your credit card in the amount written above and are hereby
                            agreeing to be bound by the policies set forth in our Terms of Use and, in particular, our
                            refund and chargeback policy restated below: I understand the product purchased will be

                            verify delivery, and I must contact Cashyew within 24 hours if I have not received my
                            delivery.
                            Chargeback Policy:
                            If you use your credit card to fund your account, YOU AGREE NOT TO CHARGE BACK YOUR CARD
                            until consulting with Cashyew Data to resolve the situation that brought about the possible
                            chargeback. Cashyew does not guarantee you will close any deals using our data. In the event
                            you breach this term and you charge back your credit card for all or partial amounts within
                            your account, you will be charged an administrative service fee of one hundred ($100)
                            dollars, which you agree to pay in addition to the amount of the Data purchase fees due for
